## Application procedure for “serious and diligent people”

### PLEASE READ THIS FIRST WITH PATIENCE 
Our target is to produce an almost-unimprovable, near-perfect result.
Embracing the natural laws of getting things done is necessary to be able to do that.
In order to achieve our goals, we would like to work with people who can successfully perform the self-management of their own mental-resources.
It simply means that we need the discipline of MAKING PROGRESS SLOWLY while checking everything we have done so far again and again and ACTIVELY WAIT until we start feeling like everything has softly been pushed to the limit and things look like they can't get any better.
